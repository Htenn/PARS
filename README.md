# Philippine Cultural College - Airline Reservation System

A website application reservation system for the BSTM and BSHM students of Philippine Cultural College. This system will help them to experience how to make airline reservations for local and international flights. The system can be used to add, edit, view and book local flights as well as identify if it is business or economy class. It can also add and update client information. PARS will retrieve, amend, and print the booking details of the clients. And finally, reports can be generated once the reservation process is done.
